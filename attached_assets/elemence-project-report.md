#### GSAP Horizontal Scroll Setup

```typescript
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import { gsap } from 'gsap';
import { ScrollTrigger } from 'gsap/dist/ScrollTrigger';

gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger);

export default function HorizontalScroll() {
  const containerRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
  const sectionsRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement[]>([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!containerRef.current) return;
    
    const sections = sectionsRef.current;
    const container = containerRef.current;
    
    // Calculate total width
    let totalWidth = 0;
    sections.forEach(section => {
      totalWidth += section.offsetWidth;
    });
    
    // Set container width
    gsap.set(container, { width: totalWidth });

    // Create horizontal scroll animation
    const scrollTween = gsap.to(container, {
      x: () => -(totalWidth - window.innerWidth),
      ease: "none",
      scrollTrigger: {
        trigger: container,
        pin: true,
        scrub: 1,
        anticipatePin: 1,
        end: () => `+=${totalWidth - window.innerWidth}`,
        invalidateOnRefresh: true
      }
    });

    // Clean up on unmount
    return () => {
      scrollTween.scrollTrigger?.kill();
    };
  }, []);

  // Add sections to ref array
  const addToRefs = (el: HTMLDivElement) => {
    if (el && !sectionsRef.current.includes(el)) {
      sectionsRef.current.push(el);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="main-wrapper">
      <div ref={containerRef} className="horizontal-container">
        <section ref={addToRefs} className="panel section-1">
          {/* Section content */}
        </section>
        <section ref={addToRefs} className="panel section-2">
          {/* Section content */}
        </section>
        {/* More sections */}
      </div>
    </div>
  );

gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger);

export default function ResponsiveScroll() {
  const containerRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
  const [isMobile, setIsMobile] = useState(false);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Check if mobile based on viewport width
    const checkMobile = () => {
      setIsMobile(window.innerWidth < 768);
    };
    
    // Initial check
    checkMobile();
    
    // Update on resize
    window.addEventListener('resize', checkMobile);
    
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('resize', checkMobile);
    };
  }, []);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!containerRef.current) return;
    
    let scrollTrigger: ScrollTrigger;
    
    if (!isMobile) {
      // Desktop horizontal scroll setup
      // Similar to previous example
    } else {
      // Mobile vertical scroll setup
      // Disable horizontal scrolling and reset styles
      gsap.set(containerRef.current, {
        width: '100%',
        x: 0
      });
      
      // Apply mobile-specific styles to sections
      document.querySelectorAll('.panel').forEach(panel => {
        gsap.set(panel, {
          width: '100%',
          position: 'relative',
          minHeight: '100vh'
        });
      });
    }
    
    return () => {
      if (scrollTrigger) scrollTrigger.kill();
    };
  }, [isMobile]);
  
  return (
    <div className={`main-wrapper ${isMobile ? 'mobile' : ''}`}>
